**Code Snippets** is a website that records various code templates, not limited
to project engineering configuration, general function library, etc.

It is very simple and fast when creating a new project, no need to rewrite the
configuration file.

- [Project Configuration](../reference/project/package-json): Front-end and Back-end project engineering configurations.
